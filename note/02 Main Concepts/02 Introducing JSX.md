# Introducing JSX

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```

JSX (Javascript XML) is a syntax extension to JavaScript, which allow us to write HTML in React. React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic. Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called components that contain both.

- **Embedding Expression in JSX** (with curly braces)
- **JSX is an Expression** (JavaScript function and object)
- **Specifying Attributes with JSX** (in camel case)
- **Specifying Children with JSX**
- **JSX Prevents Injection Attacks**
- **JSX Represents Objects**
