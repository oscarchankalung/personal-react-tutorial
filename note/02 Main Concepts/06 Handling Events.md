# Handling Events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax difference.

- **Registering Event Handlers**
- **Preventing Default Behavior**
- **Binding Event Handlers to Class**
- **Passing Arguments to Event Handlers**

Reference: https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html

## Registering Event Handlers

- React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

```jsx
// HTML
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>

// React
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

## Preventing Default Behavior

Another difference is that you cannot return `false` to prevent default behavior in React. You must call `preventDefault` explicitly

```jsx
// HTML
<form onsubmit="console.log('You clicked submit.'); return false">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

// React
function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('You clicked submit.');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Here, `e` is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events according to the W3C spec, so you don’t need to worry about cross-browser compatibility. React events do not work exactly the same as native events. See the [SyntheticEvent](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html) reference guide to learn more.

## Binding Event Handlers to Class

- Calling bind on event handlers
- Using public class fields syntax
- Using an arrow function

When you define a component using an ES6 class, a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class. For example, this `Toggle` component renders a button that lets the user toggle between “ON” and “OFF” states:

```jsx
class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {isToggleOn: true};

    // This binding is necessary to make `this` work in the callback
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      isToggleOn: !prevState.isToggleOn
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        {this.state.isToggleOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
      </button>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Toggle />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

You have to be careful about the meaning of `this` in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind `this.handleClick` and pass it to `onClick`, `this` will be `undefined` when the function is actually called.

Generally, if you refer to a method without `()` after it, such as `onClick={this.handleClick}`, you should bind that method.

### Using public class fields syntax

If calling `bind` annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. If you are using the experimental public class fields syntax, you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks:

```jsx
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick.
  // Warning: this is *experimental* syntax.
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

### Using an arrow function

If you aren’t using class fields syntax, you can use an arrow function in the callback:

```jsx
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the `LoggingButton` renders. In most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.

## Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

Inside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. For example, if `id` is the row ID, either of the following would work:

```jsx
<button onClick={(e) => this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row</button>
<button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}>Delete Row</button>
```

In both cases, the `e` argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with `bind` any further arguments are automatically forwarded.
