## Redux Toolkit

The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic.

- `configureStore()`
- `createReducer()`
- `createAction()`
- `createSlice()`
- `createSelector()`
- `createAsyncThunk()`
- `createEntityAdapter()`

## RTK Query

RTK Query is provided as an optional addon within the `@reduxjs/toolkit` package. It is purpose-built to solve the use case of data fetching and caching, supplying a compact, but powerful toolset to define an API interface layer for your app. It is intended to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application, eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching & caching logic yourself.

- `createApi()`
- `fetchBaseQuery()`
- `setupListeners()`
