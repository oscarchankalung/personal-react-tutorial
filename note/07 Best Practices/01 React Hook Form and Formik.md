# React Hook Form and Formik

Both Formik and React Hook Form are powerful libraries that will enable you to build any form you may need. They are architectured differently, with React Hook Form leading in terms of performance and ease of implementation, in part thanks to being a newer library built for modern React applications. Keep in mind that if you are working with class components, you must choose Formik.

And the winner is: React Hook Form
